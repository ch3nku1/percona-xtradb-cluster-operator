System Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++

The Operator supports Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) 5.7 and 8.0.

The new ``caching_sha2_password`` authentication plugin which is default in 8.0
is not supported for the ProxySQL compatibility reasons. Therefore both Percona
XtraDB Cluster 5.7 and 8.0 are configured with
``default_authentication_plugin = mysql_native_password``.
