.. _users:

Users
==============================

MySQL user accounts within the Cluster can be divided into two different groups:

* *application-level users*: the unprivileged user accounts,
* *system-level users*: the accounts needed to automate the cluster deployment
  and management tasks, such as Percona XtraDB Cluster Health checks or ProxySQL
  integration.

As these two groups of user accounts serve different purposes, they are
considered separately in the following sections.

.. contents:: :local:

.. _users.unprivileged-users:

`Unprivileged users <users.html#unprivileged-users>`_
------------------------------------------------------

There are no unprivileged (general purpose) user accounts created by
default. If you need general purpose users, please run commands below:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kubectl run -it --rm percona-client --image=percona:8.0 --restart=Never -- mysql -hcluster1-pxc -uroot -proot_password
   mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database1.* TO 'user1'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password1';

.. note:: MySQL password here should not exceed 32 characters due to the `replication-specific limit introduced in MySQL 5.7.5 <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-5.html>`_.

Verify that the user was created successfully. If successful, the
following command will let you successfully login to MySQL shell via
ProxySQL:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl run -it --rm percona-client --image=percona:8.0 --restart=Never -- bash -il
   percona-client:/$ mysql -h cluster1-proxysql -uuser1 -ppassword1
   mysql> SELECT * FROM database1.table1 LIMIT 1;

You may also try executing any simple SQL statement to ensure the
permissions have been successfully granted.

.. _users.system-users:

`System Users <users.html#system-users>`_
-------------------------------------------

To automate the deployment and management of the cluster components,
the Operator requires system-level Percona XtraDB Cluster users.

Credentials for these users are stored as a `Kubernetes Secrets <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/>`_ object.
The Operator requires Kubernetes Secrets before Percona XtraDB Cluster is
started. It will either use existing Secrets or create a new Secrets object with
randomly generated passwords if it didn't exist.
The name of the required Secrets (``my-cluster-secrets`` by default)
should be set in the ``spec.secretsName`` option of the ``deploy/cr.yaml``
configuration file. 

The following table shows system users' names and purposes.

.. warning:: These users should not be used to run an application.

YAML Object Format
******************

The default name of the Secrets object for these users is
``my-cluster-secrets`` and can be set in the CR for your cluster in
``spec.secretName`` to something different. When you create the object yourself,
it should match the following simple format:

.. code:: yaml

   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: my-cluster-secrets
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     root: root_password
     xtrabackup: backup_password
     monitor: monitory
     clustercheck: clustercheckpassword
     proxyadmin: admin_password
     pmmserver: admin
     operator: operatoradmin
     replication: repl_password


The example above matches
:ref:`what is shipped in deploy/secrets.yaml<users.development-mode>` which
contains default passwords. You should NOT use these in production, but they are
present to assist in automated testing or simple use in a development
environment.

As you can see, because we use the ``stringData`` type when creating the Secrets
object, all values for each key/value pair are stated in plain text format
convenient from the user's point of view. But the resulting Secrets
object contains passwords stored as ``data`` - i.e., base64-encoded strings.
If you want to update any field, you'll need to encode the value into base64
format. To do this, you can run ``echo -n "password" | base64`` in your local
shell to get valid values. For example, setting the PMM Server user's password
to ``new_password`` in the ``my-cluster-name-secrets`` object can be done
with the following command:

.. code:: bash

   $ kubectl patch secret/my-cluster-name-secrets -p '{"data":{"pmmserver": '$(echo -n new_password | base64)'}}'

Password Rotation Policies and Timing
*************************************

When there is a change in user secrets, the Operator
creates the necessary transaction to change passwords. This rotation happens
almost instantly (the delay can be up to a few seconds), and it's not needed to
take any action beyond changing the password.

.. note:: Please don't change ``secretName`` option in CR, make changes inside
   the secrets object itself.

Marking System Users In MySQL
*****************************

Starting with MySQL 8.0.16, a new feature called Account Categories has been
implemented, which allows us to mark our system users as such.
See `the official documentation on this feature <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/account-categories.html>`_
for more details.

.. _users.development-mode:

`Development Mode <users.html#development-mode>`_
--------------------------------------------------

To make development and testing easier, ``deploy/secrets.yaml`` secrets
file contains default passwords for Percona XtraDB Cluster system users.

These development mode credentials from ``deploy/secrets.yaml`` are:

============ ========================
Secret Key   Secret Value
============ ========================
root         ``root_password``
xtrabackup   ``backup_password``
monitor      ``monitor``
clustercheck ``clustercheckpassword``
proxyuser    ``s3cret``
proxyadmin   ``admin_password``
pmmserver    ``admin``
operator     ``operatoradmin``
replication  ``repl_password``
============ ========================

.. warning:: Do not use the default Percona XtraDB Cluster user passwords in
   production!
